      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>
        Hello! I'm Joseph Pham, a passionate Fullstack Developer with a deep-rooted fascination for technology. I'm currently on an exciting journey, enrolled in a Fullstack bootcamp
        at the University of Pennsylvania, where I'm honing my skills and shaping my path in the world of Web Development.
      </p>
      <p>
        My journey into the tech realm might seem unconventional, as I have a background as a retired athlete. The
        same drive, dedication, and perseverance that fueled my athletic pursuits now propel me in the direction of
        technology. I've taken the lessons learned from my athletic career—like discipline, teamwork, and pushing
        beyond boundaries—and channeled them into mastering the art of code.
      </p>
      <p>
        As I transition from the world of sports to the dynamic landscape of technology, I'm excited about the
        opportunities and challenges that lie ahead. The same passion that fueled my athletic achievements now fuels
        my desire to build elegant, functional, and impactful software solutions.
      </p>
      <p>
        Thank you for joining me on this incredible journey. Feel free to explore my portfolio to witness the fusion
        of my sporting spirit and technological aspirations.
